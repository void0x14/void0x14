**Aspiring Security Architect & Data Engineer.**

I am not just interested in how to break a system, but how to design one that survives. My passion lies at the intersection of **Cybersecurity Architecture**, **Data Orchestration**, and **AI Integration**.

I specialize in "Dataset Engineering" and creating autonomous workflows. I thrive on overcoming hardware constraints to build efficient, intelligent systems that connect the dots between raw data and actionable intelligence.

### 🧠 Core Philosophy
> *"The Architect sees the building, the Builder sees the bricks."*
> I aim to orchestrate systems where Security, Data, and AI work in unison.

### 🔭 Research & Focus Areas
*   **Security Architecture:** Designing resilient infrastructures and defense protocols (Blue Team focus).
*   **Data Engineering:** Collecting, sanitizing, and categorizing massive datasets for future AI models.
*   **AI Integration:** implementing LLMs and efficient inference engines into everyday workflows despite hardware constraints.
*   **Low-Level Curiosity:** An admiration for Reverse Engineering and Hardware security fundamentals.
